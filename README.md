# Street pollution Budapest

Aim of my project is to measure pm10 and pm25 values on the street of Budapest. I set up a small system to do so. I have a Rasberry PI and a SDS011 pollution sensor. I put all of these devices to my bike and I am riding on the street to collect pollution data. I would like to check where is less risky to ride and have a pollution map of Budapest.
